# Back_Propagation_of_Neural_Networks
## Semester 05 - Deep Neural Networks Module - Assignment 01

This assignment is designed to improve the knowledge on neural network design, back propagation and training process. 
Under this activity, we had to implement the code for a multi class classification task (given 14 features, predict the class that the data point belongs to). For this purpose, we designed a neural network with an input layer of 14 nodes, 2 hidden layers with 100 nodes and 40 nodes each and an output layer with 4 nodes. Each layer is fully connected and activated with ReLU function and the Softmax activation for the output layer. 
Then we trained the neural network using a given dataset under 3 learning rates (1, 0.1, 0.001). Then compared the accuracies, training and testing costs under the 3 learning rates to analyse the influence of learning rate on the accuracy and stability of a neural network. The analysis results are graphically represented and discussed further in the project report.
